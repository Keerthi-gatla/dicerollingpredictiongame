# Dice Rolling Prediction Game

## Purpose
This project is designed to create a fun and interactive dice rolling experience using modern web technologies. By simulating a dice roll, it allows users to generate a random number between 1 and 6, providing a visually appealing 3D dice animation.

## Getting Started
To start coding this project, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### Why We Use These Technologies:
- **HTML**: Structures the content of the webpage, defining elements like buttons, inputs, and containers for displaying results.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage and enhances user experience by adding 3D animations, transitions, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Provides the logic for the dice roll, handling user interactions, and updating the displayed results dynamically.

### How to Start Coding:
1. **Set Up Your HTML**: Create a basic HTML structure with elements like a container for the dice, buttons for rolling the dice, and elements to display the result.
2. **Style with CSS**: Use CSS to style your elements and add animations for the dice roll. Include properties like `transform` and `transition` to create the 3D effect.
3. **Add JavaScript Logic**: Implement the logic to handle user interactions, generate random dice outcomes, and update the UI accordingly.

## Key Components
- **HTML Elements**: Define the structure with elements such as `div`, `button`, and `input`.
- **CSS Styling**: Apply styles to create a visually engaging interface, using flexbox for layout and perspective for 3D transformations.
- **JavaScript Functions**: Use functions to generate random numbers, handle button clicks, and manipulate the DOM to show the dice results.
